# Bare Metal STM32F4 Rust Template ðŸ¦€

This is a template project for embedded Rust development on the **STM32F4** microcontroller family. It provides a minimal but complete setup to start writing `no_std` Rust code on Cortex-M microcontrollers. Based on [The Rusty Bits](https://www.youtube.com/@therustybits) tutorial series.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with this template, follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Install the Rust toolchain:**

   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. **Install target support:**

   You must add the target architecture to your Rust toolchain by running the following command:

   ```sh
   rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
   ```

   You can list all available targets by running:

   ```sh
   rustup show
   ```

   You may find more information about the available targets on the [Rust platform support page](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/rustc/platform-support.html).

3. **Install `probe-rs`:**

   `probe-rs` is a tool for flashing and debugging embedded devices. You can install it using Cargo:

   ```sh
   cargo install probe-rs
   ```

4. **Install `llvm-tools` for `cargo-binutils`:**

   As optional tools for working with LLVM and binary utilities, you can install `llvm-tools` and `cargo-binutils`. These tools are useful for inspecting and manipulating binaries, which can be helpful in embedded development.

   ```sh
   rustup component add llvm-tools
   ```

   ```sh
    cargo install cargo-binutils
   ```

### Building the Project

To check the project for errors, run:

```sh
cargo check
```

To build the project, run:

```sh
cargo build
```

### Flashing the firmware to the target device

To flash the firmware to the STM32F4 microcontroller, you can use the `cargo flash` command. This command uses `probe-rs` to connect to the device and upload the compiled binary. The chip name must be specified, and you can use the `--release` flag to build the project in release mode.

You can check the available STM32F4 platforms supported by `probe-rs` by running:

```sh
probe-rs chip list | grep STM32F4
```

Before flashing, ensure that the flash and RAM memory regions specified in your `memory.x` file match the memory map of your target STM32F4 device. This is important to avoid issues during flashing and runtime. In this template, the `memory.x` file is configured for the STM32F401RE microcontroller. To flash the firmware, run the following command:

```sh
cargo flash --release --chip STM32F401RE
```

Replace `STM32F401RE` with the appropriate chip name for your target device if you are using a different STM32F4 microcontroller. Also, replacing the target chip name in the `Embed.toml` file helps to avoid adding the `--chip` flag every time.

## Porting this template to other ARM platforms

- **Adding support for other ARM targets:**

   When developing for embedded targets, you need to tell Rust which target architecture you are compiling for. For example, the STM32F4 family of microcontrollers are based on the ARM Cortex-M4 architecture, which implements the ARMv7E-M architecture. You can find out the architecture of your ARM microcontroller by searching its model on the [ARM developer website](https://developer.arm.com/). On Rust's [platform support page](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/rustc/platform-support.html) you can find the corresponding target for your architecture. In this case, the target for ARMv7E-M architecture is `thumbv7em-none-eabihf`, which also supports hardware floating point operations. Target's name is usually in the format `<arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<env>`, where:

  - `<arch>`: The architecture of the target (e.g., `thumb` for ARM Cortex-M4).
  - `<sub>`: The sub-architecture or variant (e.g., `v7em` for ARMv7E-M).
  - `<vendor>` [optional]: The vendor of the target (e.g., `eabi` for the Embedded Application Binary Interface).
  - `<sys>`: The operating system or environment (e.g., `none` for bare-metal targets).
  - `<env>`: The environment or ABI (e.g., `eabi` for the Embedded ABI).

   You can add target support by running the following command:

   ```bash
      rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
   ```

   Indicating the target inside the `.cargo/config.toml` file tells Cargo to use this target when building the project, and allows you to simply run `cargo build` without specifying the target each time.

   If using the `rust-analyzer` extension in Visual Studio Code, you may replace the corresponding target to your `.vscode/settings.json` file:

   ```json
   {
    "rust-analyzer.check.allTargets": false,
    "rust-analyzer.cargo.target": "thumbv7em-none-eabihf"
   }
   ```

   This ensures that it uses the correct target for code analysis and checks.

- **The cortex-m-rt crate:**

   The `cortex-m-rt` crate provides the runtime support for Cortex-M microcontrollers, including the entry point and interrupt handling. It is essential for any embedded Rust project targeting ARM Cortex-M devices. The crate [documentation](https://docs.rs/cortex-m-rt/latest/cortex_m_rt/) provides detailed information on how to use it. The file `memory.x` is one of the key components of this crate, as it defines the memory layout for the target device. It specifies the memory regions, such as flash and RAM, which are crucial for linking and running the application correctly. The documentation also explains how to customize the `main.rs` file to set up the entry point.

   Other ARM platforms may require different runtime support crates, such as `cortex-r-rt` for Cortex-R devices or `cortex-a-rt` for Cortex-A devices. You can find more information about these crates in their respective documentation.

- **The panic handler:**

   The `panic_halt` crate is used to handle panics in embedded Rust applications. It provides a simple panic handler that halts the program when a panic occurs, which is suitable for bare-metal applications where you may not have a sophisticated error handling mechanism. You can find more information about the `panic-halt` crate in its [documentation](https://docs.rs/panic-halt/latest/panic_halt/).

- **The stm32f4xx-hal crate:**

   The `stm32f4xx-hal` crate is a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) for the STM32F4 family of microcontrollers. It provides a set of APIs to interact with the hardware peripherals, such as GPIO, timers, and communication interfaces. The crate is designed to be used in conjunction with the `cortex-m` and `cortex-m-rt` crates to provide a complete embedded Rust development experience. You can find more information about the `stm32f4xx-hal` crate in its [documentation](https://docs.rs/stm32f4xx-hal/latest/stm32f4xx_hal/).
